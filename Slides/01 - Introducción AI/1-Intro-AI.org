    1. Early humans needed to hunt, and built tools for that.
    2. Then they learnt about agriculture and built tools and trained animals
       for that.
       - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture
    3. Then they built machines to do more work in a more efficient way
    4. Eventually they built computers to help us think
       - Computing began with calculators to help scientists.

    But this is not enough. We want assistance for every task we face.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Transportation

    Yet that seems insufficient, humans are still working.

    - Can machines be intelligent?
    - At which point should we call them intelligent?

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    This is an Artificial Intelligence course, naturally one of our first
    questions would be whether that can be achieved.

    * Can computers be intelligent? Even so if they do exactly as we "say" so?
      - Programs crash even though it's "obvious" that dereferencing a null
        pointer is UB (unless we do barebone black magic).
      - Sorting algorithms will try to sort arrays that are known to be sorted.
      - We can run Bubble-sort on a large list even though there's more efficient
        algorithms.
    * At which point should we call a computer intelligent?
      - When thinking or acting rationally?
        - Understanding the models of the world and acting as if they realized
          other options were worse.
      - When thinking or acting humanly?
        - Using context, knowledge and understanding of other beings.
      - We know they can play chess and recognize cats, but that doesn't seem
        enough.
    * What's intelligence in the first place?
      - Uhmm, aren't there multiple types of intelligence?
        - Logical-mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, intra-personal,
          inter-personal, bodily-kinesthetic.
    * How to build intelligent systems?
      - Hold up, what's intelligence again?

*** A practical approach
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    #+begin_quote
    I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’

    -- Alan Turing, 1950.

    This question tries to steer away from the complexity of defining
    intelligence and focuses on a key skill for Intelligent actors.

    #+LaTeX: \note{
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Along with this question, Turing also proposed the Imitation Game, in which
    an interrogator will perform a blind test to tell apart a human and a
    computer in two separate rooms by communicating only through a paper.

    If a Machine could trick the human interrogator into believing it's a human,
    then we would be consider it intelligent enough.

    Experiments with the Turing Test.

    - *Q*: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.
    - *A*: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.
    - *Q*: Add 34957 to 70764
    - *A*: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621. ([[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Add+34957+to+70764][Sum]])
    - *Q*: Do you play chess?
    - *A*: Yes.
    - *Q*: I have K at my K1 (e1|e8), and no other pieces. You have only K at
      K6 (e3|e6) and R at R1 (a/h 1/8). It is your move. What do you play?

    Criticism,
    - A machine that writes perfectly, or too fast would give itself away.
      - Machines making typos can trick people more easily.
    - Knowing too little, or too much about the world would be suspicious.
      - Wouldn't we want to achieve super-human intelligence instead? Why stop
        at the average?

    Note that the chess position is ambiguous, yet the solution works is correct
    in all 8 interpretations (swap colors, swap sides).

*** Dissecting Intelligence
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    The Turing test appears to be insufficient.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Different modes of thinking
    - Context awareness

*** Modes of thinking
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - "Fast" thinking. System 1
      - Automated, immediate thinking/reasoning
    - "Slow" thinking. System 2
      - Manual, active thinking/reasoning

    #+LaTeX: \note{
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    System 1 seems to barely need consciousness and happens without our control
    without much apparent thinking.

    System 2 requires an active effort.

          - The computer does not fit in the bag because it's too small.
            - What's too small?
    - Perception ambiguities are also resolved by context

    Context, including knowledge, is key to understanding.

    Context happens to also be key for perception.

** AI in practice
*** Intelligent systems
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    The goal is to be able to build intelligent systems.

    Building those requires solving tasks that demonstrate intelligent behaviour
    and on top of that, systems that humans can interact with.

    We will be focusing on core tasks needed to build such systems

*** Tasks to be solved
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Dealing with human input
      - Computer Vision
      - Computer Audition
    - Understanding
      - Natural Language Processing
      - Knowledge Representation & Automated Reasoning
      - Machine Learning
    - Acting
      - Robotics
      - (Producing output for humans)

    #+LaTeX: \note{
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    These tasks are vast research fields on their own, and building a system
    that intelligently combines them still seems beyond what can be done today.

      - Playing games like Tic-tac-toe, Chess
      - Reasoning about constraints, like solving Einstein's problem
      - Understanding natural language to make usable systems
      - Understanding and producing media. Images, Video, Audio.
